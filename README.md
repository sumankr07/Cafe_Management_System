#### 2. Install MySQL Server:

You need to have MySQL Server installed on your system. You can download and install MySQL Server from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/).
    
#### 3. Install Required Python Packages:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to install the required Python packages:

```bash
  pip install mysql-connector-python pandas openpyxl
```

#### 4. Set Up MySQL Database:

Start MySQL Server if it's not already running.
Create a new database and table for the Cafe Management System. You can do this using a MySQL client or command line.
- Create Database
```bash
CREATE DATABASE cafe_management_system;
```
- Create table for Customer
```
CREATE TABLE customer (
    Customer_ID INT,
    Customer_Name VARCHAR(40),
    Phone_No BIGINT
);
```
- Create table for Product
```
CREATE TABLE product (
    Product_ID INT,
    Product_Type VARCHAR(40),
    Product_Name VARCHAR(40),
    Product_Price INT
